GuidEd Front-End Documentation
This document serves as a reference for all implemented pages and UI designs in the GuidEd project. It covers general workflows, page-specific details, collaboration guidelines with the UI/UX designer, and backend integration.

1. General Workflow
   Cloning and Setup:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the front-end folder:
bash
Copy code
cd Frontend
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Folder Structure: Organize files as follows:

scss
Copy code
src/
├── components/ // Reusable UI components
├── pages/ // Individual page components
├── assets/ // Images, icons, and other static assets
├── services/ // API calls and backend integration
├── styles/ // TailwindCSS and global styles
├── utils/ // Helper functions and utilities
└── App.js // Main application entry point
Collaboration with UI/UX Designer:

Review design prototypes (Figma/Adobe XD) provided by the UI/UX team.
Maintain pixel-perfect implementation using Tailwind CSS.
Regular feedback loops to ensure the final product matches the design. 2. Page-Specific Documentation
Sign-Up Page
Description: A page for user registration.
Location: src/pages/SignUp.js
Features:
Input fields for first name, last name, email, password, and confirm password.
Smooth animations using Framer Motion.
Backend API integration for user registration.
Dependencies: react-icons, framer-motion.
Login Page
Description: A page for user login.
Location: src/pages/Login.js
Features:
Input fields for email and password.
Password recovery link.
Smooth button animations using Framer Motion.
Dashboard
Description: A user dashboard showing personalized content.
Location: src/pages/Dashboard.js
Features:
Dynamic data rendering from backend APIs.
Interactive navigation to sub-modules. 3. Design Standards
Typography:

Font Family: Inter, Roboto, or the font specified by the UI/UX designer.
Font Sizes and Weights: Adhere to the provided style guide.
Color Palette:

Maintain the theme colors specified in the design system.
Use Tailwind classes for consistent styling.
Icons:

Use react-icons or custom SVGs provided by the UI/UX designer.
Ensure icons match the design prototype.
Animations:

Implement subtle animations using Framer Motion for buttons, form transitions, and page loads.
Keep animations smooth and performance-friendly. 4. Backend API Integration
API Services:

Store all API logic in src/services/api.js for easy reuse.
Example structure:
javascript
Copy code
import axios from "axios";

const API = axios.create({
baseURL: "https://api.guided.com",
headers: {
"Content-Type": "application/json",
},
});

export default API;
API Testing:

Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to test endpoints before integrating them into the UI.
Ensure error handling covers all scenarios (e.g., network errors, invalid responses). 5. Front-End Standards
Code Styling:

Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting.
Follow functional component patterns with React hooks.
Responsive Design:

Test all components across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Use Tailwind's responsive utilities (sm, md, lg) to adapt layouts.
Reusability:

Abstract common elements (e.g., input fields, buttons) into reusable components in src/components.
Version Control:

Commit changes with descriptive messages:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Implemented Login Page with API integration"
Push changes to feature branches and open pull requests for code reviews. 6. Collaboration Guidelines
Team Communication:

Share progress daily in the team stand-ups.
Highlight any blockers or dependencies from other teams.
Code Reviews:

Submit pull requests for every feature or page implemented.
Peer review all code before merging into the main branch.
Design Feedback:

Regularly sync with the UI/UX designer to align on design changes or discrepancies. 7. Tools and Resources
Libraries:
React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, React Icons, Axios.
UI/UX Tools:
Figma, Adobe XD.
Testing Tools:
Postman (API testing), Browser DevTools (UI testing). 8. Future Improvements
Create a Style Guide for typography, spacing, and colors to standardize designs across pages.
Implement State Management using Context API or Redux for large-scale state handling.
Optimize performance by code-splitting and lazy-loading components.

This documentation will ensure clarity for the entire team.
